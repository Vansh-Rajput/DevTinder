# About Routes in Express
- Avoid using '/' on top as it will over write all other routes if mentioned, it works like a wildcard....
- use it at last, and provide rest of the unique routes first...
- if you use '/hello' route, then /hello/....anything.... will also now work like a wildcard not /helloanything.
- whenever we are making typing any url on browser, we are making a GET api call or using a GET method...
- res.send() is response sent back to client once task is done, its not something stored in server...
